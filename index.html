<p>This Heat were an British experimental trio operating within the post-punk landscape of the late 70's and early 80's. Formed in 1976, the band released two full-length albums as well as a 12" single prior to their split in 1982. Their work was intensely inventive, even in comparison to numerous other inventive bands operating in the post-punk idiom during this period. Their 1979 debut album <em>This Heat</em> drew from such varied areas as musique concrete, krautrock, free jazz, and industrial, while 1980's <em>Health And Efficiency</em> 12" and 1981's <em>Deceit</em> LP focused on more conventional song-structures while refusing to water-down their more esoteric influences. Though sales eluded the outfit, their work would stand as massively influential on numerous bands and musicians as the decades wore on, with everyone from Liars to Massive Attack to Danny Brown acknowledging influence. In 2006, a box set of their at the time long out-of-print catalog was issued with vinyl reissues of their two albums and 12" appearing this year.</p>
